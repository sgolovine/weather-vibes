# Weather Vibes

This is a simple weather app that I "vibe coded". It is intended to evaluate how well "vibe coding" actually works.

## Issues Found

This is non-exhaustive list of the various issues I ran into while developing this application.

- Initially the React project was boilerplated with Create React App. Had to re-prompt to get it to configure it with Vite.
- When asking to convert the project to use TailwindCSS, the agent got confused with the various packages and kept trying to fix the issues again and again. Eventually had to manually intervene and setup TailwindCSS by hand.
